# iOS component for the Gateway
General Authentication Service


# Swift
- updated to Swift 4.2!;)
- updated/fixed for XCode 11.1
- 4 years in the &making
- updated to Swift 5.x (2020)
- updated to WKWebView

# Notes on iOS build:
- You should run 'POD install' to install the pods into your local environment. After installing the pods you must run the project with SwiftLoginScreen.xcworkspace!
- if you want to exclude any pods you may break the code therefor I strongly recommend to install all the pods you find in the podfile!
- AFNetwork is an Objective-C dependency that is supposed to be re-installed as the official Objective-C class bridging into Swift code describes it, if any problem occurs. 
- You may need full internet connection depending on your AFNetwork settings
- Check also the Other Linker Flags for consistency
- Take care of the App Transport Security Exceptions: it needs to be set accordingly to run on https
- If you use self-signed certs with the server, you must install your custom cerificate authority file onto your server and device/simulator  (You must use certificate authority format - I use it with Apache http server with mod_jk AJP connector on GlassFish or TomCat).
- strictly follow the instructions at [Using Self Signed SSL Certificates with iOS](https://blog.httpwatch.com/2013/12/12/five-tips-for-using-self-signed-ssl-certificates-with-ios/) and go with Tip # 5: Consider Creating Your Own Certificate Authority (CA). You will have two choices, however: either you import the CA on the server, or install it on the device.

### CFNetwork Debug and using Instruments
- in general the built-in XCode Profiler is fine. However, I cannot get it run with XCode 10.1, for some of its tools, that I was able to use in XCode 9.*, because the CoreProfile.framework is missing
- please check out this article: [CFNetwork Debug and using Instruments](https://www.agnosticdev.com/blog-entry/networking-swift/advanced-network-debugging-xcode)


### CriptoJS
- please check-out this source, that gives a comprehensive understanding, as to how to use the encryptions. I guess it's fine for those, who just want to implement the function: [crypto-js](https://code.google.com/archive/p/crypto-js/) 

### CoreData cache
- there is a CoreData based cache mechanism built in, that works from the UrlProtocol. If you don't want to use it, just uncomment the following function:

```swift
func connectionDidFinishLoading(_ connection: NSURLConnection!) {
    self.client!.urlProtocolDidFinishLoading(self)
  //  self.saveCachedResponse()
}
```

The CoreData cache is taking care of the caching of the webpage and its sources the first time you open up the WebView, so that the app does not need to download it from the server again, and the deviceId will be put into the app.js, for the sake of convinience. 

The CoreData cache will store also the images of the movies and venues, if you use the full system, found through AWS repository.

All the data will be rerieved based on the url.

You can access and check the data with SqlLite. 

### Realm cache
- the app also includes another cache system, out of convinience, which is the Realm cache. It is taking care of storing the responses of the Booking api.

You can access and check the data with Realm browser.

### Document Directory on the device and simulator
- please check for the following print out in the logs, that will tell you where you can find the dB locations:

```swift
        let urls = FileManager.default.urls(for: .documentDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)
         print("dB location: \(urls[urls.count-1] as URL)")
```

### URL Loading System
- the app has 3 different request manager, combined with a NSUrlProtocol, and a WebView, therefor it is advisable to read the official Apple documentation, as to how it works (cookies, etc) 
- [URL Loading System](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url_loading_system) 
- [NSMutableURLRequest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsmutableurlrequest)
- [HttpCookieStorage](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/httpcookiestorage)
- the app uses 2 different cookies, the JSESSIONID, and XSRF-TOKEN. Both abide the naming strategy, and standards, and it's part of the URL Loading System, how they are sent and recieved, while the WebView only initiates the request, the cookies are managed by the app's default CookieStorage, and not the WebView, which some may think confusingly. The path the server uses is '/login' for both cookies. You can introduce more cookies, if you want.

#### Configure cookie handling
You can set up the policy at three different points, at the same time:


Since the app employs a custom UrlProtocol class, it gives you the possibility to take control over the some request - response of any NSUrlConnection, by making deep copies with NSMutableRequest, witch means you can add/modify header fields, set Cookie policy, etc. 

### WKWebView
WKHTTPCookieStore

Each instance of WKWebView has its own cookie storage container, which is named WKHTTPCookieStore.
Once the user logs in to the iOS app, we obtain the auth access token from the server. Use the following for sharing the auth token across the native app and to the embedded webpage at WKWebView, back and forth.

# How it works
- it's a login and movie ticket booking system. Please checkout the other stuff of my works at the following repository:

### gitRepo link to AWS

### AWS repos for the movie ticket booking API

Web Debugging tool for iOS, web:
- [Charles Web Proxy Debugging](https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/welcome/) - to use Charles you may need to modify your app transport security settings to allow traffic.
- if everythings is set and both the Charles and your server CA certificates are in place you can verify the traffic between your server and iOS client app.
