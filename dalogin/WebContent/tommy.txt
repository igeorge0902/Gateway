Dear Customer Service,

I'm writing you, because I wish to return an item, and I would like to ask for a return label, that was not in the box. My email address associated with the order is igeorge1982@hotmail.com, as I payed with PayPal. Would you please send me the return label, so that I can send the item back?

Kind Regards,
Gyorgy Gaspar
